# c-minesweeper
a console based minesweeper in C made for a friend as his school project

Comments are in Farsi/Persian since he wanted to understand each part.  
This was made a year ago for one of my friends, back then he was searching for a source code on the internet and he couldn't find any.  
So now I decided to put it on github
